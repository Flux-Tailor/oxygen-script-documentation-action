# Oxygen Documentation Action
This action triggers <i>Oxygen Scripting</i> to generate documentation for schema files on your repository. All you have to do is to include this action in your workflow and choose the schema to document. Find more info about workflows on https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows.

# Requirements
In order to use this action, you need to obtain an <i>Oxygen Scripting</i> license key from https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_scripting/pricing.html (you can also request a [trial](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_scripting/register.html)). Add it as a secret to your repository (Settings &rarr; Secrets &rarr; Actions &rarr; New repository secret), and name it "SCRIPTING_LICENSE_KEY".
Then use it as an environment variable:
```yaml
env:
  SCRIPTING_LICENSE_KEY: ${{secrets.SCRIPTING_LICENSE_KEY}}
```

# Sample usage

If you don't already have a workflow defined in your repository, you can use one of the samples below.

ðŸ’¡ This workflow requires manual trigger from the 'Actions' tab:
```yaml
name: Run Documentation Script
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      schemaFile:
        description: 'Schema file to generate documentation for.'
        required: true # e.g. resources/schema.xsd
jobs:
  generate-doc:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Oxygen Documentation Script
        uses: oxygenxml/oxygen-script-documentation-action@v1.0.0
        env:
          SCRIPTING_LICENSE_KEY: ${{secrets.SCRIPTING_LICENSE_KEY}}
        with:
          schemaFile: ${{ inputs.schemaFile }}
```
# Deployment to GitHub Pages
After a successful run of the Documentation Script, the documentation files are pushed to the <i>gh-pages</i> branch. 
If you want the documentation to be published to GitHub Pages, all you have to do is go to Settings &rarr; Pages, and under <i>Build and deployment</i> section select the <i>gh-pages</i> branch instead of the <i>main</i> branch. 
The deployment workflow should automatically start and the documentation should be available shortly at: https://{userid}.github.io/{reponame}/{schemaFile}.html.
